## Right hand rv, rf, ng, and nk

* `-FRB` is "-rv" as in "swe<ins>rv</ins>e"
* `*FRB` is "-rf" as in "tu<ins>rf</ins>"

> The reason `-FRB` is "-rv" and not "-rf" is that the former is a bit more common.

* `-PBG` represents two sounds:
  * "-ng" as in "ta<ins>ng</ins>"
  * "-nj" as in "stra<ins>ng</ins>e"
* `*PBG` is "-nk" as in "pla<ins>nk</ins>"

![rv, rf, ng, nk](img/10-rv-rf-ng-nk.png)

### Examples
* curve `KUFRB`
* carve `KAFRB`
* turf `T*UFRB`
* serf `S*EFRB`
* ling `HREUPBG`
* sing `SEUPBG`
* tank `TA*PBG`
* sink `S*EUPBG`

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. `-FRB` contains the `-R` key and also looks like the letter "v" on its side
2. The "v" and "f" sounds are quite similar; the "-rf" chord is almost the same as the "-rv"  but with the asterisk
3. `-PBG` is simply just the "n" chord and the `-G` key combined
4. `*PBG` is just the "-ng" chord with the asterisk (the "-ng" and "-nk" sounds are quite similar)

## Right hand ch, sh, and rch

* `-FP` is "-ch" as in "cou<ins>ch</ins>"
* `-RB` is "-sh" as in "tra<ins>sh</ins>"
  - `-RBS` is the "shus" sound as in "cau<ins>tious</ins>"
* `-FRPB` represents two sounds:
  - "-rch" as in "a<ins>rch</ins>"
  - "-nch" as in "hu<ins>nch</ins>"

![ch, sh, rch](img/10-ch-sh-rch.png)

### Examples
* hitch `HEUFP`
* patch `PAFP`
* mash `PHARB`

* luscious `HRURBS`
* spacious `SPAEURBS`
* larch `HRAFRPB`
* parch `PAFRPB`
* crunch `KRUFRPB`
* punch `PUFRPB`

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. `-FP` and `-RB` are rows of horizontal keys pressed by the right hand index and middle fingers
   - These are both *h chords, remember that `-FP` comes before `-RB` in steno order which matches up with the letter "c" coming before "s" in the alphabet
2. The "-rch"/"-nch" chord `-FRPB` is the combination of the previous two

| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| be | `-B` | Single key brief for a common word |

| even | `AOEFPB` | Drops the second vowel |
| of | `-F` | Single key brief for a common word |
| one | `WUPB` | Not so much a brief as just an odd word |

| self | `SEFL` | Uses an inversion of steno order |
