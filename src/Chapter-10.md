## Right hand rv, rf, ng, and nk

* `-FRB` is "-rv" as in "swe<ins>rv</ins>e"

<steno-outline stroke="-FRB" width="100%" alt="-FRB on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `*FRB` is "-rf" as in "tu<ins>rf</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="*FRB" width="100%" alt="*FRB on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

> The reason `-FRB` is "-rv" and not "-rf" is that the former is a bit more common.

  * "-ng" as in "ta<ins>ng</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-PBG" width="100%" alt="-PBG on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

### Mnemonics:

1. `-FRB` contains the `-R` key and also looks like the letter "v" on its side
2. The "v" and "f" sounds are quite similar; the "-rf" chord is almost the same as the "-rv"  but with the asterisk
3. `-PBG` is simply just the "n" chord and the `-G` key combined
4. `*PBG` is just the "-ng" chord with the asterisk (the "-ng" and "-nk" sounds are quite similar)

* `-FRPB` represents two sounds:
  - "-rch" as in "a<ins>rch</ins>"
  - "-nch" as in "hu<ins>nch</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-FRPB" width="100%" alt="-FRPB on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. `-FP` and `-RB` are rows of horizontal keys pressed by the right hand index and middle fingers
   - These are both *h chords, remember that `-FP` comes before `-RB` in steno order which matches up with the letter "c" coming before "s" in the alphabet
2. The "-rch"/"-nch" chord `-FRPB` is the combination of the previous two

## Chapter briefs

> This section is completely optional, but recommended. If you prefer to learn these all at once, they will be covered in chapter 16.

| Translation | Brief | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| be | `-B` | Single key brief for a common word |
| been | `PW-PB` | Drops the vowel |

| even | `AOEFPB` | Drops the second vowel |
| of | `-F` | Single key brief for a common word |
| one | `WUPB` | Not so much a brief as just an odd word |
| only | `OEPBL` | <ins>onl</ins>y |
| self | `SEFL` | Uses an inversion of steno order |
| they | `THE` | <ins>the</ins>y |
| think | `THEU` | <ins>thi</ins>nk (easier to write than `TH*EUPBG`) |

> **NOTE:** remember that these are briefs; the explanations are not applicable to any arbitrary word.
