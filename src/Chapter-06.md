## Left hand f, q, and m

* `TP` is "f" as in "<ins>f</ins>ad"
* `KW` is "q" as in "<ins>q</ins>uit"
* `PH` is "m" as in "<ins>m</ins>od"

![f, q, and m on the steno layout](img/6-fqm.png)

### Examples

* far `TPAR`
* flat `TPHRAT`
* quill `KWEUL`
* quip `KWEUP`
* met `PHET`
* more `PHOR`

### Wouldn't `PH` as "f" make more sense? 

Why not use `PH` for "f"? After all, this would be easier to remember since "ph" has the same sound as "f". However, it would be impossible to chord "fl" sounds as the `PH` and `HR` chords overlap. `PHR` already represents the initial "pl" consonants. We would run into ambiguity if we also defined `PHR` to be the "fl" consonants (e.g., "plat" and "flat").

### Mnemonics

1. Each of these chords are simply two keys in a row
   * `TP` is the top row pressed by the ring and middle fingers
   * `KW` is the bottom row pressed by the ring and middle fingers
   * `PH` is the top row pressed by the middle and index fingers
2. Think "FQM" in steno order (top to bottom, left to right!)
   * <ins>f</ins>ully <ins>q</ins>ualified <ins>m</ins>ountain
   * <ins>f</ins>irst <ins>q</ins>uill <ins>m</ins>ade

## Left hand g, n, and y

* `TKPW` is "g" as in "<ins>g</ins>et"

> **NOTE:** `TKPW` is only used for the "hard g" sound. For example, the word "gel" would not use `TKPW` as the initial consonant is a "soft g" (a "j" sound).

* `TPH` is "n" as in "<ins>n</ins>ot"
* `KWH` is "y" as in "<ins>y</ins>et"

**`KWH` is only used when the word starts with the letter "y"; if a word has a "y" sound but doesn't start with a "y", simply don't use a left hand consonant chord.**

### Examples

* gloss `TKPWHROS`
* gull `TKPWUL`
* nap `TPHAP`
* net `TPHET`
* yet `KWHET`
* yes `KWHES`
* use `AOUS`

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. Grapes nourish you
1. `TKPW` is a group of 4 keys pressed by the ring and middle fingers
1. `TPH` is a row of 3 keys pressed by the ring, middle, and index fingers
1. `KWH` is three keys in a rising shape, like the intonation when asking "why?"

## Left hand z, v, and j

* `STKPW` is "z" as in "zit"
* `SR` is "v" as in "vat"
* `SKWR` is "j" as in "job"

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. Zits are '<ins>sg</ins>usting!
2. The chemical element strontium (symbol <ins>Sr</ins>) is not <ins>v</ins>anadium
3. `SKWR` is just the bottom row of the left hand

### Examples

* zap `STKPWAP`
* zip `STKPWEUP`
* var `SRAR`
* ver `SRER`
* jib `SKWREUB`
* jot `SKWROT`
